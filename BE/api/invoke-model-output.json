Malware\nMalware refers to malicious software such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, etc. Hackers trick users into installing malware on their systems which can steal data, spy on users, encrypt files, and cause other harm.\n\n2. Phishing\nPhishing involves sending fraudulent emails purporting to be from reputable sources in order to get recipients to reveal sensitive information like passwords and credit card numbers. Spear phishing targets specific individuals.\n\n3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks\nA DoS attack aims to shut down a machine or network resource to legitimate users by flooding the target with traffic or sending it malformed requests. Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks come from many coordinated sources.\n\n4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks\nMitM attacks intercept communications between two parties to eavesdrop or impersonate one party. Hackers can steal data this way without the victims realizing the channel is compromised. \n\n5. SQL Injection\nSQL injection targets databases by inserting malicious SQL statements into application queries. This allows hackers to access sensitive information they normally couldn't retrieve.\n\n6. Password Attacks\nHackers use methods like brute-force attacks to guess passwords, especially weak ones. Password spraying tries a single weak password against many accounts. Keylogging malware records keystrokes to capture passwords.\n\n7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nXSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The malicious scripts can access cookies and session tokens to hijack user sessions.\n\n8. Zero-Day Exploits\nZero-day exploits target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities before a patch is available. Hackers race to write exploit code and launch attacks before defenses are in place.\n\nTo defend against these threats, infosec teams should employ security best practices like vulnerability management, prompt patching, strong authentication, network monitoring, anti-malware tools, web application firewalls, and continuous security training for employees. Layered defenses and proactive security are key."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn"}
